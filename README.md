# Exploring π Through Collisions

This small project demonstrates how the mathematical constant π emerges from a fascinating physics experiment involving collisions between two masses and an immovable wall.

## The Setup
Imagine two objects with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), along with an immovable wall. The masses move and collide with each other and the wall, obeying the laws of elastic collisions.

- **Masses**: \(m_1 = 1\), \(m_2 = 100^n\), where \(n \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}\)
- **Wall**: Positioned to the left of \(m_1\), preventing further motion.

## Key Insight: Collisions and π
The total number of collisions in this setup is directly related to the digits of π:

- If \(n = 0\), the number of collisions is **3** (first digit of π).
- If \(n = 1\), the number of collisions is **31** (first two digits of π).
- If \(n = 2\), the number of collisions is **314** (first three digits of π).
- And so on...

This remarkable result connects the physical behavior of the system to the digits of π!
